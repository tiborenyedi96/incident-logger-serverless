# Serverless Incident Logger
This is the serverless version of my previous [incident logger](https://github.com/tiborenyedi96/incident-logger) project.\
I have built this project after passing the AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification to apply my skills by designing and building a secure, scalable and cost-effective application in the cloud using only serverless components, following IaC principles with Terraform, and building Github Actions pipelines for automation and efficiency.
